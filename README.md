# rocksdb-asset-cache
Asset Cache is a RocksDB based caching management service designed to streamline the indexing and purging of cached files. It efficiently updates file indices whenever files are cached or modified and ensures their timely removal when files are evicted or purged. By employing a local queue to buffer incoming purge requests, Asset Cache utilizes a background process to identify and delete files based on these requests. Additionally, it ensures immediate compliance with purge operations by checking for outdated files during cache hits, preventing them from being returned even if the actual deletion process is still in progress.
